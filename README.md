## <a name="intro"></a>What is *COVID-19 Tracking System*?

This project is a web application that aims to visualize and track reported cases of coronavirus disease COVID-19 in real time and provides the general public, exspecially for travelers, with disease guidance and important travel advices. 

It includes following features:

+ Case in US monthly Analysis 
+ Global Map for confirmed case location
+ State cases details (categorizing by State)
+ Travel Advice (categorizing by Country)
+ WHO Daily Reports (categorizing by date)
+ About COVID-19 

This projects uses open data source from [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/summary.html), [Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE)](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), and [Word Health Organization(WHO)](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports). Whenever the system starts running, it will fetch the real-time data from these open data source and update accordingly. The data including the location and number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries will be updated everyday.


## <a name="importance"></a>Why is this important?


In December 2019, an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel (new) coronavirus that was first detected in China and which has now been detected in almost 90 locations internationally, including in the United States. 

In response to this ongoing public health emergency, we developed this project to provide a user-friendly tool to track the outbreak as it unfolds. The real-time information analysis reveals the rapid spreading of the disease which will certainly have a great impact on the public’s “movement“. 

It is important to ensure easy accessibility of such information for both domestic and international travelers for decision making. We believe our effort in building the COVID-19 Tracking System makes this information accessible and crucial to help people stay aware and prevent, well in advance, from suffering health problems during the earliest stages of the outbreak.
